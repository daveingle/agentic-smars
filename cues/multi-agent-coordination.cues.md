# Multi-Agent Coordination

**Generated from**: Bootstrap initiative for foundational cues

(cue agent_state_persistence ⊨ suggests: implement symbolic memory structures to maintain agent state across interaction cycles)

(cue inter_agent_validation_requests ⊨ suggests: establish protocols for agents to request validation from peer agents using structured messaging)

(cue distributed_task_allocation ⊨ suggests: create mechanisms for dynamic task distribution among available agents based on capability matching)

(cue agent_capability_declaration ⊨ suggests: require agents to declare their symbolic processing capabilities and domain expertise)

(cue coordination_conflict_resolution ⊨ suggests: implement priority-based resolution when multiple agents claim authority over the same symbolic domain)

(cue collective_decision_making ⊨ suggests: establish voting or consensus mechanisms for multi-agent decisions using confidence metrics)

(cue agent_lifecycle_management ⊨ suggests: define protocols for agent instantiation, suspension, and termination within the SMARS substrate)
