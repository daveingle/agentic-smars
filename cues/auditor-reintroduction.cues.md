# Auditor Reintroduction Cues

## Context
Following symbolic hallucination detection and Swift implementation creation, these cues guide the reintroduction of an auditor to verify concrete artifacts and prevent future hallucinations.

## Cues for Auditor Integration

(cue swift_implementation_validation ⊨ suggests: "Compile and execute SMARSAgent.swift to verify it produces actual runtime output, not just syntactic correctness")

(cue foundation_models_integration_gap ⊨ suggests: "Current Swift implementation lacks Apple Foundation Models API calls - this gap must be acknowledged and addressed")

(cue concrete_artifact_verification ⊨ suggests: "Auditor should verify file existence, line counts, compilation success, and execution results rather than accepting symbolic claims")

(cue hallucination_measurement_methodology ⊨ suggests: "Establish objective criteria for measuring symbolic hallucination rate - count executable artifacts vs unsubstantiated claims")

(cue platform_consistency_enforcement ⊨ suggests: "Swift implementation choice aligns with Apple Foundation Models framework - maintain this consistency rather than defaulting to Python")

(cue execution_trace_auditing ⊨ suggests: "Auditor should verify that ExecutionStep structs contain actual shell command outputs, not placeholder data")

(cue specification_to_implementation_gap ⊨ suggests: "SMARS specification parsing exists but Foundation Models integration remains symbolic - bridge this gap with real API calls")

(cue self_validation_capability_test ⊨ suggests: "Test whether Swift SMARSAgent can parse and execute its own specification file as proof of self-validation capability")

(cue lineage_chain_verification ⊨ suggests: "Auditor should trace complete artifact lineage from original request through Swift implementation to execution results")

(cue reality_grounding_enforcement ⊨ suggests: "Require compilation success, execution completion, and output file generation as mandatory evidence for implementation claims")

## Auditor Reintroduction Protocol

(cue auditor_validation_checklist ⊨ suggests: "
1. Verify SMARSAgent.swift compiles without errors
2. Execute swift run and capture actual output
3. Confirm execution report JSON file generation
4. Validate shell command execution produces real results
5. Test SMARS file parsing with concrete specifications
6. Measure gap between specification and implementation
7. Document Foundation Models integration status
8. Assess hallucination reduction through artifact count
")

(cue objective_measurement_criteria ⊨ suggests: "Define concrete metrics: files created, lines of code, compilation success, test pass rate, execution time, output file size")

(cue progressive_validation_approach ⊨ suggests: "Start with basic Swift compilation, then execution, then SMARS parsing, then shell command execution, building evidence incrementally")

(cue foundation_models_integration_priority ⊨ suggests: "Next critical milestone is actual Apple Foundation Models API integration with real model calls and response handling")

(cue hallucination_prevention_mechanism ⊨ suggests: "Establish automated verification pipeline that prevents progression from specification to implementation claims without executable evidence")
