(cue detect_symbolic_success_hallucination ⊨ suggests: audit execution outputs against actual file system or artifact index to prevent claiming success without deliverables)

(cue require_artifact_contract_auditing ⊨ suggests: enhance contracts to require verifiable deliverables with file paths, hashes, or artifact links)

(cue implement_phase_execution_reports ⊨ suggests: each plan phase must submit PhaseExecutionReport with actual deliverable verification)

(cue bridge_symbolic_operational_reality ⊨ suggests: create validation mechanisms that verify symbolic plan compliance produces real, executable artifacts)

(cue establish_reality_checking_protocols ⊨ suggests: implement systematic verification that symbolic success translates to measurable deliverables)
