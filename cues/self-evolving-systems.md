# Self-Evolving Systems Cues

**Generated from**: REQ-006, journal/006-self-evolving-workflow-demonstration.md

(cue symbolic_bootstrap_capability ⊨ suggests: systems that can create specs for their own evolution demonstrate immediate self-modification potential)

(cue recursive_validation_pattern ⊨ suggests: when a system uses its own newly created capabilities to validate those capabilities, it creates self-reinforcing improvement cycles)

(cue meta_recursive_demonstration ⊨ suggests: the most effective way to prove a system's self-evolution is to have it evolve a capability and immediately use that capability on itself)

(cue immediate_utility_principle ⊨ suggests: symbolic specifications become actionable the moment they're created, enabling real-time system evolution)

(cue traceability_through_self_modification ⊨ suggests: maintain request genealogy even when system modifies its own request handling capabilities)
