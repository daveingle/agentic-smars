# Gap Analysis Enhancement

**Generated from**: Bootstrap utility demonstration - filling analytical gaps

(cue cognitive_architecture_validation_gap ⊨ suggests: spec/smars-dev/phase2.prototyping.smars.md lacks reality verification mechanisms for cognitive architecture validation)

(cue prototype_system_verification_gap ⊨ suggests: PrototypeSystem type missing artifact verification requirements to prevent symbolic hallucination)

(cue demo_success_metrics_gap ⊨ suggests: UseCaseDemo success_metrics need concrete verification protocols beyond threshold scoring)

(cue external_integration_reality_gap ⊨ suggests: ExternalIntegration missing actual API testing and runtime validation requirements)

(cue community_feedback_validation_gap ⊨ suggests: CommunityOutreach needs structured feedback collection and validation mechanisms)

(cue prototype_execution_audit_gap ⊨ suggests: buildSMARSExecutor function lacks artifact contract auditing for prototype deliverables)

(cue multi_agent_demonstration_gap ⊨ suggests: demonstrateMultiAgent missing inter-agent communication verification protocols)

(cue llm_framework_integration_gap ⊨ suggests: integrateWithLLMFrameworks needs concrete compatibility testing and artifact validation)
