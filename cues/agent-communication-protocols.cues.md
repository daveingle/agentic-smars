# Agent Communication Protocols

**Generated from**: Bootstrap initiative for foundational cues

(cue structured_message_formats ⊨ suggests: establish standardized message schemas for inter-agent communication within SMARS substrate)

(cue communication_channel_management ⊨ suggests: implement channel creation, subscription, and lifecycle management for agent messaging)

(cue message_routing_optimization ⊨ suggests: create efficient routing mechanisms to deliver messages to appropriate agents based on capability and availability)

(cue communication_security_protocols ⊨ suggests: implement authentication and authorization for agent-to-agent communication)

(cue message_persistence_strategy ⊨ suggests: establish policies for message storage, retrieval, and retention across agent lifecycles)

(cue communication_failure_handling ⊨ suggests: create robust mechanisms for handling communication failures, timeouts, and unreachable agents)

(cue protocol_versioning_management ⊨ suggests: implement versioning for communication protocols to enable backward compatibility during system evolution)

(cue broadcast_coordination_mechanisms ⊨ suggests: establish protocols for system-wide announcements and coordinated multi-agent operations)
