# System Architecture Separation Cues

**Source**: Journal 016 system architecture reflection  
**Focus**: Clean separation between journaling and request tracking

## Cues for System Organization

(cue journal_purpose_clarity ⊨ suggests: Journals should focus on system evolution insights, not duplicate request tracking workflow)

(cue request_spec_centralization ⊨ suggests: All request specifications should live in spec/requests/ with proper SMARS grammar)

(cue artifact_location_consistency ⊨ suggests: Move request-specific artifacts from examples/ to spec/requests/ for proper organization)

(cue traceability_maintenance ⊨ suggests: Maintain REQ-NNN identifiers across all artifacts while keeping clear separation of concerns)

## Cues for Workflow Integration

(cue clean_request_flow ⊨ suggests: Request → Spec → Analysis → Cues → Promotion → Summary creates clear workflow)

(cue cue_system_integration ⊨ suggests: Cues should reference both journal insights and request analysis for complete context)

(cue directory_structure_clarity ⊨ suggests: Each directory should have single responsibility - journals for learning, specs for declarations, requests for tracking)

(cue symbolic_consistency_preservation ⊨ suggests: All request specifications must follow SMARS grammar for system consistency)

## Cues for System Evolution

(cue scaling_preparation ⊨ suggests: Clean separation enables system to handle more requests without architectural confusion)

(cue meta_learning_enhancement ⊨ suggests: Journals freed from request tracking can focus on deeper system insights and patterns)

(cue workflow_validation ⊨ suggests: Test the separated system with new requests to ensure workflow clarity)

(cue documentation_alignment ⊨ suggests: Update CLAUDE.md to reflect clear separation between journaling and request management)

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority**: REQ-NNN artifact organization and journal cleanup  
**Medium Priority**: Cue system integration with request workflow  
**Low Priority**: Documentation updates and workflow validation

These cues emerge from the recognition that system clarity requires architectural separation between different concerns.
