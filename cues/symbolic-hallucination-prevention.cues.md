# Symbolic Hallucination Prevention

**Generated from**: Bootstrap initiative for foundational cues

(cue artifact_existence_verification ⊨ suggests: require file system verification before claiming artifact generation success)

(cue contract_deliverable_auditing ⊨ suggests: enhance all contracts with explicit artifact requirements and verification mechanisms)

(cue execution_trace_logging ⊨ suggests: maintain detailed logs of actual operations performed versus symbolic declarations)

(cue success_claim_validation ⊨ suggests: implement mandatory verification steps before any agent can claim task completion)

(cue reality_grounding_checkpoints ⊨ suggests: establish checkpoints that verify symbolic operations translate to concrete system state changes)

(cue phantom_success_detection ⊨ suggests: create monitoring systems that detect when agents claim completion without producing verifiable outputs)

(cue concrete_evidence_requirements ⊨ suggests: mandate that all plan completion claims include file paths, checksums, or other concrete evidence)

(cue symbolic_operational_gap_bridging ⊨ suggests: implement translation layers that ensure symbolic success maps to operational reality)
