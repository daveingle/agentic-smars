# SMARS Self-Specification Pattern

(cue smars_develops_itself ⊨ suggests: use SMARS plans to define its own roadmap and structure, placing them in spec/smars-dev/)

This establishes a meta-specification pattern where SMARS uses its own symbolic language to define its development roadmap, evolution strategy, and structural decisions. The `spec/smars-dev/` directory contains formal symbolic specifications that are commitments about SMARS development itself, not exploratory journal entries or soft guidance cues.
