## Problem 1: Speed and Time with Multiple Scenarios

**Problem Statement**: Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

**Problem Type**: Algebra/Rate Problems  
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium  
**Expected Solution Steps**: 6-8 steps  
**Key Concepts**: Rate, time, distance relationships, systems of equations

**Answer Range**: 0-999 minutes

## Problem 2: Logarithmic Equations

**Problem Statement**: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log_x(y^x) = log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. Find xy.

**Problem Type**: Algebra/Logarithms  
**Difficulty**: Medium-High  
**Expected Solution Steps**: 5-7 steps

**Answer Range**: 0-999 (integer value of xy)

## Problem 3: Game Theory Token Removal

**Problem Statement**: Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of n tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes 1 token or 4 tokens from the stack. The player who removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 such that there is a strategy that guarantees that Bob wins, regardless of Alice's moves.

**Problem Type**: Game Theory/Combinatorics  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Expected Solution Steps**: 4-6 steps  
**Key Concepts**: Game theory, winning/losing positions, modular arithmetic

**Answer Range**: 0-2024 (count of winning positions for Bob)

## Problem 4: Lottery Probability

**Problem Statement**: Jen enters a lottery by selecting 4 distinct elements of S={1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then four elements of S are drawn at random. Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were drawn, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are drawn. The probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that Jen wins a prize is m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.

**Problem Type**: Probability/Combinatorics  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Expected Solution Steps**: 5-8 steps  
**Key Concepts**: Combinations, conditional probability, complementary counting

**Answer Range**: 0-999 (value of m+n)

## Problem 5: Rectangle Geometry

**Problem Statement**: Rectangle ABCD has dimensions AB = 107 and BC = 16, and rectangle EFGH has dimensions EF = 184 and FG = 17. Points D, E, C, and F lie on line DF in that order, and A and H lie on opposite sides of line DF, as shown. Points A, D, H, and G lie on a common circle. Find CE.

**Problem Type**: Geometry/Coordinate Geometry  
**Difficulty**: Medium-High  
**Expected Solution Steps**: 6-10 steps  
**Key Concepts**: Coordinate geometry, rectangle properties, circle geometry

**Answer Range**: 0-999 (length CE)
