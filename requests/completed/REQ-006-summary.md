# REQ-006: Self-Evolving Workflow Demonstration

**Request Description**: "demonstrate self-evolving system by creating new journal entry using new workflow"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: completed  

## Summary

Successfully demonstrated the self-evolving nature of SMARS by applying the newly created `meta-request-management.smars.md` workflow to itself. This meta-recursive demonstration showed that the system can use its own symbolic specifications to process requests about the system itself.

## Key Outcomes

1. **Self-Referential Capability**: System applied its own request management workflow to process a request about that workflow
2. **Immediate Utility**: New specs became actionable within the same session
3. **Symbolic Bootstrap**: Demonstrated how SMARS enables systems to modify their own behavior symbolically
4. **Workflow Validation**: Confirmed the request management workflow functions correctly through recursive use

## Generated Artifacts

- Journal entry 006 (initially created as request tracking, later converted to proper reflection)
- Cues about system self-modification capabilities
- Evidence of self-evolution milestone achievement

## Lessons Learned

- The act of documentation changes the system through symbolic processes
- Workflow becomes real through use, not just specification
- Self-validation occurs when system demonstrates its own capabilities
- Traceability maintained through REQ-006 identifier across all artifacts

**Milestone Achieved**: Self-evolution capability confirmed through recursive demonstration.
