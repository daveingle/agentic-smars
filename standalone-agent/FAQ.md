# SMARS Standalone Agent - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Usage

### Q: What is the SMARS Standalone Agent?

A: The SMARS Standalone Agent is a self-contained planning system that takes natural language prompts and converts them into executable SMARS (Symbolic Multi-Agent Reasoning System) specifications. It provides deterministic execution with reality grounding and multi-agent coordination capabilities.

### Q: How do I get started with basic planning?

A: Simply run the agent with a natural language prompt:

```bash
cargo run -- --prompt "Your planning request here"
```

The agent will:
1. Convert your prompt to a SMARS specification
2. Validate the plan against baseline requirements
3. Execute steps with user interaction as needed
4. Provide reality-grounded results with confidence metrics

### Q: What's the difference between single-agent and multi-agent mode?

A: Single-agent mode (default) handles straightforward tasks with one planning agent. Multi-agent mode (`--multi-agent` flag) spawns multiple specialized agents (validation, simulation, decision) that collaborate on complex tasks requiring different expertise areas.

## Planning Complex Projects

### Q: How do I use SMARS to plan and execute a new SaaS product?

A: For SaaS product planning, use a comprehensive prompt that covers all phases:

```bash
cargo run -- --prompt "Plan and execute development of a project management SaaS product with user authentication, real-time collaboration, and subscription billing" --multi-agent --verbose
```

**Expected Planning Cycle:**

**Phase 1 - Requirements & Analysis:**
- The agent will request user input for:
  - Target market and user personas
  - Core features and MVP scope
  - Technical requirements and constraints
  - Business model and pricing strategy

### Q: How do I use SMARS to plan and execute an entry in a Kaggle competition?

A: For Kaggle competition planning, provide specific competition details:

```bash
cargo run -- --prompt "Plan and execute a winning entry for the 'House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques' Kaggle competition, including data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and submission optimization" --multi-agent
```

**Expected Planning Workflow:**

**Phase 1 - Competition Analysis:**
- Agent requests input for:
  - Competition URL and rules
  - Evaluation metric understanding
  - Submission deadline and format
  - Available computational resources

**Phase 2 - Data Exploration:**
- SMARS plan generates steps for:
  - Download and examine training data
  - Identify data quality issues
  - Perform exploratory data analysis
  - Understand target variable distribution

**Phase 3 - Feature Engineering:**
- Multi-agent coordination provides:
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Missing value handling strategies
  - Categorical encoding recommendations
  - Feature scaling and transformation

**Phase 4 - Model Development:**
- Generated plan includes:
  - Baseline model establishment
  - Advanced algorithm experimentation
  - Cross-validation strategy
  - Hyperparameter optimization

**Phase 5 - Submission & Iteration:**
- Reality grounding ensures:
  - Submission files are generated
  - Leaderboard scores are tracked
  - Model performance is validated
  - Iteration improvements are measured

**Sample Advanced Usage:**
```bash
# Include competition-specific context
cargo run -- --prompt "Plan Kaggle competition entry for time series forecasting with ensemble methods, focusing on feature engineering from datetime components and external data integration" --multi-agent --verbose --max-cycles 15
```

## Advanced Features

### Q: How does reality grounding work in practice?

A: Reality grounding prevents "symbolic hallucination" by requiring actual artifacts:

- **Code Files**: Generated code must exist and compile
- **Data Files**: Analysis results must be saved to verifiable files  
- **Test Results**: Tests must actually run and pass
- **Metrics**: Performance measurements must be reproducible

Example reality-grounded step:
```
Step 3: implement_core_functionality
  ✅ Success: true
  📁 Artifacts Created:
    • /project/src/main.py
    • /project/tests/test_main.py
    • /project/requirements.txt
  🔗 Reality Grounded: true
```

### Q: When should I use multi-agent mode?

A: Use multi-agent mode (`--multi-agent`) for:

- **Complex Projects**: Multiple interconnected components
- **High-Stakes Decisions**: Need validation from different perspectives
- **Technical Uncertainty**: Benefit from simulation and risk assessment
- **Quality Critical**: Require validation agent oversight

Single-agent mode works well for:
- **Straightforward Tasks**: Clear requirements and execution path
- **Learning/Research**: Exploratory analysis and investigation
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iteration and experimentation

### Q: How do I customize the planning approach?

A: Control planning behavior through prompt engineering:

**For Agile Development:**
```bash
cargo run -- --prompt "Using agile methodology with 2-week sprints, plan development of a mobile app for expense tracking with user stories, acceptance criteria, and sprint planning"
```

**For Research-Focused Planning:**
```bash
cargo run -- --prompt "Following scientific method, plan comprehensive analysis of customer churn patterns including hypothesis formation, experimental design, and statistical validation"
```

**For Risk-Averse Planning:**
```bash
cargo run -- --prompt "With emphasis on risk mitigation and thorough validation, plan deployment of machine learning model to production including A/B testing, monitoring, and rollback procedures"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The agent keeps asking for clarification. How do I provide better prompts?

A: Improve prompts by being specific about:

- **Scope**: Define clear boundaries and deliverables
- **Context**: Provide domain knowledge and constraints  
- **Success Criteria**: Specify how to measure completion
- **Resources**: Mention available tools, data, or infrastructure

**Poor Prompt:**
```
"Build a website"
```

**Better Prompt:**
```
"Build a responsive e-commerce website using React and Node.js, with product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and Stripe payment integration, targeting small retail businesses"
```

### Q: What should I do if the planning cycle doesn't achieve the goal?

A: The agent provides several continuation options:

1. **Automatic Replanning**: Agent suggests refined approach
2. **User Guidance**: Provide additional context or constraints
3. **Scope Reduction**: Break complex goals into smaller phases
4. **Multi-Agent Consultation**: Enable `--multi-agent` for complex problems

**Example Failed Cycle Response:**
```
❓ Plan validation failed. Please provide more details or adjust your request: 
The requirements are too broad. Could you specify the target platform, main features, and technical constraints?
```

### Q: How do I save and analyze planning sessions?

A: The agent offers session saving at completion:

```
❓ Save this session for later analysis? (y/n): y
💾 Session saved to: smars_session_20240722_204500.json
```

**Session Analysis:**
```bash
# View session summary
cat smars_session_*.json | jq '.execution_history[].confidence_level'

# Extract artifacts created
cat smars_session_*.json | jq '.execution_history[].artifacts_created[]'

# Analyze success patterns
cat smars_session_*.json | jq '.execution_history[] | select(.success == true)'
```

## Integration & Benchmarking

### Q: How do I use this for benchmarking against other planning systems?

A: The standalone agent is designed for benchmarking:

1. **Copy Directory**: Entire `standalone-agent/` directory is self-contained
