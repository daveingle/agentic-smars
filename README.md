# Agentic SMARS

**Agentic SMARS** is a structured system for symbolic specification and agentic software development.  
It defines a deterministic, verifiable planning model using a custom DSL: **SMARS** â€” the Symbolic Multi-Agent Reasoning System.

This repository consolidates the language, operating procedure, and supporting structure for systems or developers exploring **symbol-level planning and behavior modeling**.

---

## Purpose

This is not a product or a toolchain. It is a reference implementation of a symbolic workflow that allows:

- Declarative reasoning about plans, tests, branches, and contracts
- Separation of specification from execution
- Self-auditable planning by agents or humans
- Interoperability with deterministic AI workflows

## What is SMARS?

SMARS is a symbolic language designed to:

- Define types (`kind`), constants (`datum`), functions (`maplet`), and procedures (`plan`)
- Enforce behavior through contracts
- Provide conditional logic via branches
- Define expected results using symbolic tests

A SMARS specification is both readable and auditable. It acts as an interface between declarative logic and real-world implementation.

## Goals of This Repo

- Provide a formal structure for reasoning about agentic systems
- Enable symbolic auditing of plans, branches, and expected behavior
- Allow LLMs, developers, or interpreters to interact with plans as structured logic
- Encourage self-validating iteration with clear symbolic semantics

## Feedback

This system is under active development and refinement.  
While contributions are not currently accepted, feedback is welcome.

You can open an issue to:

- Ask a question about the language or workflow
- Suggest a cue, structure, or symbolic clarification
- Challenge an assumption with a counterexample
