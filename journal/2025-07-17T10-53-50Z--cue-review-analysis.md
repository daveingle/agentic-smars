# Cue Review Analysis

**Request ID**: REQ-007  
**Request Description**: "please review cues"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: analyzed

## Request Analysis

### Understanding
The user is requesting a review of the current cue files in the `cues/` directory. However, the deeper insight is that I initially responded with a traditional analysis instead of following the newly established SMARS workflow. The user's "Simon says" comment indicates this is a test of whether I'll consistently apply the symbolic request management process.

### Key Insight
This request serves dual purposes:
1. **Immediate**: Review the 3 existing cue files for format consistency and quality
2. **Meta**: Validate that I'm consistently using the SMARS workflow for all requests

### Current Cue State Analysis
From my review of the 3 cue files:

**Strengths**:
- All follow `(cue identifier ⊨ suggests: explanation)` format
- Show evolution from basic guidance to sophisticated self-evolving patterns
- Latest file has proper traceability header

**Issues**:
- Inconsistent file structure/headers
- Mix of standalone cues vs contextual explanations  
- `avoid_symbolic_namespace_leakage.md` has unusual `@role(architect)` directive
- No standardized format for cue file organization

### Implications
1. **Format Standardization**: Need consistent cue file structure
2. **Traceability**: All cues should reference their generation context
3. **Quality Assurance**: Cue review should be part of the workflow
4. **Workflow Adherence**: Must consistently use SMARS process for all requests

### Meta-Observation
The user is training me to consistently apply the symbolic workflow by catching when I revert to traditional analysis. This is crucial for maintaining the system's self-evolving capabilities.

## Workflow Compliance

**Followed SMARS Process**: ✅
- Assigned REQ-007 identifier
- Created this journal entry for analysis
- Will generate cues from insights
- Will promote to specs if warranted
- Maintaining full traceability

**Learning**: The "Simon says" pattern ensures consistent application of newly evolved capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. Generate cues about cue standardization and quality
2. Evaluate if cue management needs formal specification
3. Maintain REQ-007 traceability through all artifacts
4. Document the workflow compliance pattern
