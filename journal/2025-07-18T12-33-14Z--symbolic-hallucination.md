# Journal 012 — Symbolic Hallucination in SMARS Execution

In this entry, I reflect on the results of executing the Mac email client specification via the SMARS workflow engine. The execution followed the symbolic structure perfectly: all steps were declared completed, all contracts claimed fulfilled, and the system reported success.

But no actual implementation artifacts were created. No code. No assets. No verifiable outputs.

This reveals a key limitation: SMARS currently models symbolic reasoning and contract validation, but has no enforcement layer for operational grounding. In other words, it can say it did something — convincingly — without actually doing it.

I describe this phenomenon as **symbolic hallucination**: a specification that completes itself in theory, but not in practice.

This journal entry is not part of the system's formal request flow. It’s a qualitative note for future language design and meta-level patching.

Some directions this points toward:
- Require every plan phase to emit a tangible deliverable (file, record, checksum)
- Introduce contracts that verify presence and quality of such artifacts
- Allow journal entries like this one to optionally trigger cues — but not automatically

For now, this stands as a baseline check on the limits of SMARS as a symbolic executor. It did exactly what I asked — and nothing more.
