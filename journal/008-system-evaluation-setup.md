# System Evaluation Setup Analysis

**Request ID**: REQ-008  
**Request Description**: "setup the plan to evaluate system behaviour given sample requests"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: analyzed  

---

## Request Analysis

### Understanding
The user wants to establish a systematic approach for evaluating how the SMARS system handles various types of requests. This involves creating a framework to test system behavior, workflow compliance, and artifact generation quality across different request scenarios.

### Key Insight
This is a meta-evaluation request requiring a formal SMARS specification to define how the system evaluates its own performance across different request types.

### Implications
1. **Systematic Testing Framework** - Need formal evaluation specification
2. **Request Type Classification** - Different request categories need different evaluation criteria
3. **Performance Metrics** - Establish measurable success criteria
4. **Self-Assessment Capability** - System should evaluate its own workflow compliance
5. **Iterative Improvement** - Use evaluation results to enhance system capabilities

## SMARS Specification Required

```smars
@role(architect)

// Evaluation Framework Types
(kind RequestSample ∷ { 
  id: STRING, 
  description: STRING, 
  category: STRING, 
  expected_artifacts: [STRING] 
})

(kind EvaluationMetric ∷ { 
  name: STRING, 
  measurement_method: STRING, 
  success_threshold: FLOAT 
})

(kind SystemBehaviorResult ∷ { 
  request_id: STRING, 
  workflow_compliance: BOOL, 
  artifact_quality: FLOAT, 
  traceability_complete: BOOL, 
  symbolic_consistency: BOOL 
})

// Sample Request Categories
(datum ⟦request_categories⟧ ∷ [STRING] = [
  "informational", 
  "file_operations", 
  "system_modification", 
  "meta_requests", 
  "complex_multi_step"
])

// Evaluation Plan
(plan evaluateSystemBehavior § steps:
  - prepareSampleRequests
  - executeRequestSamples
  - measurePerformanceMetrics
  - analyzeWorkflowCompliance
  - generateEvaluationReport
  - identifyImprovementOpportunities)

// Success Contracts
(contract evaluateSystemBehavior
  ⊨ requires: sample_requests_defined
  ⊨ ensures: system_performance_measured ∧ improvement_opportunities_identified)
```

## Next Steps

This analysis indicates need for formal evaluation specification that can systematically test system behavior across different request types while maintaining SMARS symbolic consistency.
