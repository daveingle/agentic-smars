# Journal Entry – TDD Analogy for SMARS

**Title:** Planning-Driven Development: A TDD Analogy for SMARS

## Insight

Today I recognized a clear and powerful analogy between SMARS and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Where TDD defines system behavior through tests before implementation, SMARS does something similar for planning and agency.

SMARS operates as a kind of *Planning-Driven Development*:

- Instead of unit tests, we assert **symbolic goals and constraints**.
- Instead of writing functions, we compose **agentic actions and maplets**.
- Instead of test failures, we encounter **invalidated assumptions or blocked planning paths**.
- Each plan cycle acts like a **red-green-refactor loop**, but with symbolic evaluation and forward-time simulation.

The major difference is that SMARS doesn’t enforce a binary test outcome—it explores a **symbolic and interpretive landscape** through agent deliberation and contextual reasoning. The feedback loop is less about pass/fail and more about *restructuring belief and intent* until a viable outcome emerges.

## Implication

Framing SMARS in this way gives me a grounding metaphor when explaining the system. It bridges the gap between deterministic systems engineering and emergent symbolic interaction. This also points toward a **formalized methodology**—call it Planning-Driven Development (PDD)—where symbolic goals, context compression, and agentic execution form the scaffolding for both simulation and deployment.

## Next Steps

- Consider formalizing this as part of a methodology chapter or whitepaper section.
- Illustrate the SMARS planning cycle with a TDD loop side-by-side for contrast.
- Evaluate whether this analogy helps define roles (like Agent as TestRunner, Maplet as Function, Cue as Assertion).
- Prototype a minimal `smars test` command for evaluating symbolic plans in isolation.
