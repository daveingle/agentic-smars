# Design System Interface Exploration

## Context

Explored SMARS's interface capabilities through a design system thought experiment, starting with brand color `#FEBA00` and working toward a complete design system specification.

## Key Insight: The Interface Tension

SMARS excels at **structural relationships** but struggles with **semantic/aesthetic reasoning**. The challenge: how do you symbolically represent the relationship between `#FEBA00` and "warm, energetic button states"?

## What Works Well

- **Structural skeleton**: Component hierarchies, token relationships, validation rules
- **Contracts as design rules**: `⊨ ensures: contrast_ratio > 4.5`
- **Branching for contextual behavior**: `⎇ when context = "error": → red_variant`
- **Constants for brand foundations**: `(datum ⟦brand_primary⟧ ∷ Color = { hex: "#FEBA00" })`

## What's Challenging

- **Aesthetic reasoning**: Why `#FEBA00` suggests "premium energy"
- **Creative translation**: How color psychology translates to typography choices
- **Subjective design decisions**: The human intuition that resists symbolic formalization

## Potential Solutions

1. **Heavy use of cues** for aesthetic reasoning:
   ```smars
   (cue brand_color_psychology
     ⊨ suggests: FEBA00 conveys optimism and energy, apply to primary actions)
   ```

2. **Layered approach**: Symbolic precision for structure, advisory cues for aesthetics

3. **Domain-specific contracts**: Design rules that bridge the gap between symbolic and semantic

## Core Observation

Design systems live at the intersection of formal structure and human creative intent. SMARS's interface challenge is wanting to be both formally precise AND capture aesthetic reasoning.

The most promising approach may be accepting this dual nature rather than forcing everything into symbolic precision.

## Open Questions

- Where is the sweet spot between symbolic precision and advisory cues?
- Can aesthetic reasoning be systematized enough for symbolic representation?
- How do we handle the inherently subjective aspects of design within a formal system?

## Implications for SMARS Development

This exploration suggests SMARS needs:
- Rich cue system for capturing non-formalizable insights
- Domain-specific contract types for different reasoning modes
- Clear boundaries between what should be symbolic vs advisory
