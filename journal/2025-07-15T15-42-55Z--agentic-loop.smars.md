# Agentic Loop — Meta-Level Development Cycle

This journal entry defines a symbolic plan describing the SMARS-based agentic development workflow itself.

The goal is to encode a complete symbolic lifecycle: from specification to implementation, evaluation, and iterative refinement.

```smars
//Symbolic Specification

@role(architect)

(kind Artifact ∷ { id: STRING, kind: STRING, location: STRING })
(kind Evaluation ∷ { target: STRING, result: STRING, notes: STRING })

(datum ⟦grammar_spec⟧ ∷ STRING = "grammar/smars.ebnf.md")
(datum ⟦sop_doc⟧ ∷ STRING = "sop/smars-sop.md")

(maplet declareSpec ∷ STRING → Artifact)
(maplet implementSpec ∷ Artifact → Artifact)
(maplet reviewSpec ∷ Artifact → Evaluation)
(maplet updatePlan ∷ Evaluation → Artifact)

(contract declareSpec
⊨ requires: id ≠ ""
⊨ ensures: kind = "spec")

(contract implementSpec
⊨ requires: kind = "spec"
⊨ ensures: kind = "implementation")

(contract reviewSpec
⊨ requires: kind = "implementation"
⊨ ensures: result ≠ "")

(plan agenticDevelopmentLoop § steps:
    - declareSpec
    - implementSpec
    - reviewSpec
    - updatePlan
)

(test closed_loop_verification expects: "loop complete")

(cue modularize_meta_plans
⊨ suggests: split meta-level planning into reusable patterns across domains)

(cue test_review_integration
⊨ suggests: explore automatic cue promotion based on unresolved test coverage)

(cue agent_self_reflection
⊨ suggests: define a contract for when an agent should emit review or update plans)
```

Audit
    - All identifiers are defined
    - Plan is cyclic and structurally closed
    - Contracts validate transitions between states
    - All cues are optional, symbolic, and scoped

Commentary

This plan formalizes the symbolic loop used throughout the SMARS system:
    - Each module begins with a symbolic declaration
    - An implementation interprets that logic
    - A review phase validates and reflects on success
    - The result updates the plan or produces new cues

The cycle is intentionally self-similar and inspectable, supporting agent-driven collaboration with symbolic reasoning at every phase.
