# Reporting Requirement Integration Analysis

**Request ID**: REQ-012  
**Request Description**: "accommodate new PhaseExecutionReport requirements"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: analyzed  
**Category**: system_enhancement

## Request Analysis

### Understanding
The user has provided a refined SMARS specification for PhaseExecutionReport that simplifies and standardizes the reporting requirements. This replaces the more complex structure from REQ-011 with a streamlined approach.

### Key Changes

**New PhaseExecutionReport Structure**:
```smars
(kind PhaseExecutionReport ∷ {
  phase: STRING,
  artifact_path: STRING,
  artifact_type: STRING,
  verified: BOOL,
  notes: STRING
})
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Simplified Structure** - Cleaner, more focused fields
2. **Artifact Manifest** - Global tracking via `artifact_manifest` datum
3. **Validation Focus** - Direct `verified` boolean rather than complex scoring
4. **Standardized Plan** - `validateExecutionIntegrity` with clear steps
5. **Enhanced Cue** - `detect_symbolic_success_without_output` for hallucination prevention

### Integration Requirements

**Replace in `spec/automation/artifact-contract-auditing.smars.md`**:
- Update PhaseExecutionReport kind definition
- Add artifact_manifest datum
- Integrate validateDeliverables maplet and contract
- Include validateExecutionIntegrity plan
- Add enhanced cue for symbolic success detection

### SMARS Integration

```smars
@role(architect)

// Updated Core Types
(kind PhaseExecutionReport ∷ {
  phase: STRING,
  artifact_path: STRING,
  artifact_type: STRING,
  verified: BOOL,
  notes: STRING
})

// Global Artifact Tracking
(datum ⟦artifact_manifest⟧ ∷ [PhaseExecutionReport] = [])

// Validation Functions
(maplet validateDeliverables ∷ [PhaseExecutionReport] → BOOL)

// Enhanced Contracts
(contract validateDeliverables
  ⊨ requires: all(report in reports, report.verified = true)
  ⊨ ensures: result = true)

// Execution Integrity Plan
(plan validateExecutionIntegrity § steps:
  - gatherPhaseReports
  - validateDeliverables)

// Enhanced Cue
(cue detect_symbolic_success_without_output
  ⊨ suggests: require validateDeliverables to complete all symbolic execution plans)
```

### Implications
1. **Streamlined Reporting** - Simpler, more maintainable structure
2. **Global Tracking** - Artifact manifest provides system-wide visibility
3. **Clear Validation** - Boolean verified flag eliminates ambiguity
4. **Standardized Process** - Consistent validation across all plan executions
5. **Enhanced Detection** - Better symbolic hallucination prevention

### Meta-Observation
This refinement demonstrates iterative improvement of the artifact auditing system based on practical implementation needs. The simplified structure maintains validation rigor while improving usability.

## Next Steps

1. Generate cues about enhanced reporting integration
2. Update artifact contract auditing specification with new requirements
3. Integrate validateExecutionIntegrity plan into system workflows
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing specifications

This integration enhances the system's ability to prevent symbolic hallucination through streamlined but rigorous reporting requirements.
