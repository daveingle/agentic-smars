**Request ID**: REQ-013  
**Request Description**: "update smars-sop.md with Cue Handling Policy. Introduce a repeatable rule that scans the cues, evaluates them and promotes/rejects with reporting"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: analyzed  
**Category**: process_enhancement

## Request Analysis

### Understanding
The user wants to establish a formal, repeatable process for managing cues in the SMARS system. This involves creating a systematic approach to scan, evaluate, and either promote or reject cues based on defined criteria, with comprehensive reporting.

### Key Requirements

**1. Systematic Cue Scanning**
- Regular review of all cue files in `cues/` directory
- Identification of promotion candidates vs. advisory-only cues
- Assessment of cue quality and relevance

**2. Evaluation Criteria**
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Alignment with system objectives
- Implementation complexity evaluation
- Value proposition analysis

**3. Promotion/Rejection Process**
- Clear criteria for promotion to formal specifications
- Structured rejection process with documented rationale
- Reporting mechanism for all decisions

**4. Repeatable Methodology**
- Standardized evaluation framework
- Consistent application across all cues
- Audit trail for decision-making

### SMARS Policy Structure

```smars
@role(architect)

// Cue Evaluation Types
(kind CueEvaluation ∷ {
  cue_id: STRING,
  evaluation_score: FLOAT,
  promotion_recommended: BOOL,
  rejection_reason: STRING,
  evaluator: STRING,
  evaluation_date: STRING
})

(kind CueReport ∷ {
  total_cues_evaluated: INTEGER,
  promoted_count: INTEGER,
  rejected_count: INTEGER,
  pending_count: INTEGER,
  evaluation_summary: [STRING]
})

// Evaluation Process
(plan cueHandlingProcess § steps:
  - scanCueDirectory
  - evaluateCueQuality
  - assessPromotionCriteria
  - makePromotionDecision
  - generateCueReport
  - updateCueStatus)

// Evaluation Contracts
(contract cueEvaluation
  ⊨ requires: cue_format_valid = true ∧ evaluation_criteria_applied = true
  ⊨ ensures: promotion_decision_documented = true ∧ rationale_provided = true)
```

### Policy Components

**1. Cue Discovery and Scanning**
- Systematic directory scanning
- Format validation
- Traceability verification

**2. Evaluation Criteria Framework**
- Technical feasibility (0-1 scale)
- System alignment (0-1 scale)
- Implementation complexity (0-1 scale)
- Value proposition (0-1 scale)

**3. Decision Matrix**
- Promotion threshold (e.g., combined score > 0.7)
- Rejection criteria (e.g., technical infeasibility)
- Deferral conditions (e.g., insufficient information)

**4. Reporting Requirements**
- Individual cue evaluation reports
- Aggregate statistics
- Trend analysis
- Action items for promoted cues

### Implications
1. **Systematic Cue Management** - Prevents cue backlog and ensures evaluation
2. **Quality Assurance** - Consistent evaluation criteria across all cues
3. **Transparency** - Clear rationale for all promotion/rejection decisions
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular review cycle enables system evolution
5. **Audit Trail** - Complete documentation of cue lifecycle

### Meta-Observation
Establishing formal cue handling policy transforms ad-hoc cue management into a systematic process that ensures valuable insights are captured and acted upon while maintaining system coherence.

## Next Steps

1. Generate cues about cue evaluation methodology
2. Read current sop/smars-sop.md to understand existing structure
3. Integrate cue handling policy into SOP documentation
4. Define specific evaluation criteria and thresholds

This policy enhancement will formalize the cue-to-spec promotion process and ensure systematic evaluation of all advisory suggestions.
