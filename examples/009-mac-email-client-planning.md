# Mac Email Client Planning Analysis

**Request ID**: REQ-009  
**Request Description**: "plan the creation of a Mac native email desktop client, fully featured with modern APIs"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: analyzed  
**Category**: demonstration

## Request Analysis

### Understanding
The user wants a comprehensive plan for developing a native macOS email client with modern API integrations. This is a demonstration of applying SMARS workflow to external software project planning.

### Key Insight
This request tests the system's ability to apply SMARS symbolic planning to concrete application development while maintaining workflow consistency.

### SMARS Planning Requirements

```smars
@role(software_architect)

// Email Client Architecture Types
(kind EmailClient ∷ {
  platform: STRING,
  architecture: STRING,
  feature_set: [STRING],
  api_integrations: [STRING],
  development_phases: [STRING]
})

(kind ModernAPI ∷ {
  service_name: STRING,
  integration_type: STRING,
  authentication_method: STRING,
  data_sync_capability: STRING
})

(kind DevelopmentPhase ∷ {
  phase_name: STRING,
  duration_estimate: STRING,
  deliverables: [STRING],
  dependencies: [STRING]
})

// Core Features
(datum ⟦core_features⟧ ∷ [STRING] = [
  "multi_account_support",
  "unified_inbox", 
  "advanced_search",
  "smart_filtering",
  "encryption_support",
  "calendar_integration",
  "contacts_management",
  "offline_sync"
])

// Development Plan
(plan macEmailClientDevelopment § steps:
  - defineArchitecture
  - designUserInterface
  - implementCoreFeatures
  - integrateModernAPIs
  - developSyncEngine
  - implementSecurity
  - performTesting
  - deployAndDistribute)

// Success Contract
(contract macEmailClientDevelopment
  ⊨ requires: native_macos_requirements_met
  ⊨ ensures: fully_featured_email_client_delivered ∧ modern_api_integrations_complete)
```

### Implications
1. **Complex Application Architecture** - Requires detailed technical planning
2. **Modern API Integration** - OAuth2, Microsoft Graph, Gmail API, etc.
3. **Native macOS Development** - SwiftUI, AppKit, macOS frameworks
4. **Structured Development Phases** - Clear deliverables and dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Generate cues about email client architecture and API integration
2. Create comprehensive SMARS specification for development planning
3. Define implementation phases and technical requirements
4. Establish success criteria and validation metrics

This demonstrates SMARS workflow application to external software development projects.
