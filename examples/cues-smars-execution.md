# SMARS Execution Cues

**Generated from**: REQ-010, examples/010-smars-execution-analysis.md

(cue systematic_plan_execution ⊨ suggests: execute SMARS plans by creating implementation artifacts for each plan step while maintaining contract compliance)

(cue phase_based_artifact_generation ⊨ suggests: generate specific deliverables for each development phase that fulfill the behavioral contracts defined in the specification)

(cue contract_validation_during_execution ⊨ suggests: validate behavioral contracts at each phase completion to ensure specification compliance and quality)

(cue traceability_through_execution ⊨ suggests: maintain request traceability from original specification through all generated implementation artifacts)

(cue progressive_development_approach ⊨ suggests: structure execution so each phase builds upon previous phases, following dependency requirements)
