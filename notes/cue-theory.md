# Cue Theory

A cue is a non-binding symbolic suggestion for future extension, validation, or exploration.

It differs from a contract or plan in that it makes no structural demand, but offers a direction.

## Properties

- Cues are passive: they are not part of plan execution.
- Cues may reference any declared symbol (kind, maplet, datum).
- Cues may eventually become contracts, plans, or branches â€” but are never required to.

This doc will evolve as I discover when cues are useful, ignored, or misleading.
