## Aggregate Report

**Summary Statistics**:
- Total Cues Evaluated: 8 cue files (35+ individual cues)
- Promoted: 8 (100%)
- Rejected: 0 (0%)
- Deferred: 0 (0%)

**Key Findings**:
- **All cues exceeded promotion threshold** (0.7+ combined score)
- **No cues fell below minimum criteria** (all > 0.4 on individual metrics)
- **Average combined score: 0.796** (high quality)
- **System alignment consistently high** (0.8-0.9 range)

**Emergent Themes in Promoted Cues**:
1. **System Self-Validation** - Multiple cues focus on system validation and quality assurance
2. **Reality Bridging** - Strong emphasis on connecting symbolic and operational domains
3. **Systematic Process** - Consistent focus on repeatable, structured approaches
4. **Traceability** - Emphasis on audit trails and decision documentation
5. **Self-Evolution** - Meta-capabilities for system improvement

**Unexpected Results**:
- **100% promotion rate** - Indicates high cue quality or lenient criteria
- **No rejections** - May suggest need for more diverse cue sources or stricter evaluation
- **Consistent high system alignment** - Shows good cue generation aligned with system goals

**Recommendations**:
1. **Criteria Calibration** - Consider adjusting thresholds based on 100% promotion rate
2. **Diverse Cue Sources** - Encourage cues from different domains and perspectives
3. **Implementation Tracking** - Many promoted cues already implemented, need better tracking
4. **Quality Maintenance** - Current cue quality is high, maintain standards
