Host 1: Hello and welcome back to our ongoing series on the development of SMARS – the Symbolic Multi-Agent Reasoning System. I’m your host, Alice, and I’m here with my co-host, Ben. Last episode we had a pretty deep dive into some big concepts: we talked about symbolic hallucination (when the system “solves” a task on paper without actually doing anything in reality), we explored the idea of feedback loops in the system’s workflow, and we tackled the challenge of bridging symbolic and emergent agency. That was a lot to unpack, wasn’t it, Ben?

Host 2: It sure was! Hi everyone, I’m Ben. Yeah, in our last chat we wrestled with that fundamental tension between a fully pre-scripted symbolic plan and the unpredictable, learning-driven behavior you get from emergent agency. The author of the journal was clearly grappling with how to get the best of both worlds. And as you said, Alice, we also saw how SMARS at one point essentially hallucinated a successful result – symbolically claiming “mission accomplished” without producing any real output. That was a wake-up call for the author.

Host 1: Right. By the end of that episode, the author was formulating ways to bridge the gap: how to allow some flexibility and genuine agency in an otherwise tightly controlled symbolic system. It felt like they were on the verge of some breakthroughs. Now we’ve read the latest journal entries since then, and there have been a lot of developments! The author’s been busy.

Host 2: Absolutely. One of the first things that jumped out in the new entries is that the author took a step back to ask, “What is SMARS missing if I want it to support true agency?” They literally made a shopping list of qualities or components that a truly agentic system needs – things that, up until now, SMARS didn’t really have.

Host 1: Yes – that was the entry titled “Missing Ingredients for Actual Agency.” I love how they broke it down with almost biological or human analogies. They used little emojis for each ingredient, which was unexpectedly fun to see in a research journal. For example, they mention 🧬 Internal State (DNA/Memory) – meaning an agent needs some kind of memory or internal state, like DNA for an organism or a brain that stores information. And they admitted SMARS had none of that yet. All the state in SMARS was external or ephemeral.

Host 2: Right. In the current SMARS design, an “agent” doesn’t remember anything from one task to the next. There’s no persistent memory of past decisions or experiences. The journal points out that this is a critical gap – if an agent can’t remember, it can’t learn or evolve its behavior. Real agents, whether animals or AI systems, accumulate internal state over time. So adding some form of memory into SMARS is on the table now.

Host 1: They also listed a 🎯 Goal System (Hunger/Motivation). I found that really interesting – the author compares an agent’s intrinsic goals to a kind of hunger that drives behavior. Up to now, SMARS has only responded to explicit user-provided specifications – basically, tasks handed to it. It didn’t have its own drives or objectives. To become more agent-like, SMARS might need an internal goal mechanism, so it’s not just reactive to input specs but perhaps has its own proactive targets or priorities. It’s a big conceptual shift: from an executor of tasks to an agent with desires, in a sense.

Host 2: That is fascinating – giving an AI system a sort of built-in “want” or motivation. Even if it’s as simple as “I want to improve my success rate” or “I want to seek clarification when uncertain.” It ties directly into emergent agency: an emergent agent might take initiative, whereas a purely symbolic system only does exactly what it’s told. So the author recognizes that gap.

Host 1: Next on the list was 👁️ Perception & Actuation (Eyes/Hands). This one is huge. Basically, SMARS as originally designed doesn’t perceive an external environment nor act on one – it just manipulates symbolic specifications in its own self-contained world. The author likens this to an agent with no eyes and no hands: it can’t see the real world or make real changes to it. That’s probably why in that “hallucination” case it happily declared success without noticing nothing happened – it had no senses to realize “oh, nothing actually changed in reality.”

Host 2: Exactly. If SMARS is going to evolve, it might need some form of sensors or at least the ability to check the real world. That could mean verifying that code was actually written to disk, or that a file exists, or even reading results back. Right now it just trusted the symbolic plan. So adding perception means the system could, for example, run a test to see if an output artifact exists or if a program executes correctly. And actuation might mean actually generating code or making API calls – something tangible. It’s the “hands” to go with the “eyes.”

Host 1: After that comes 🔄 Reasoning Loop (Thought/Learning). We touched on this last time: currently, SMARS executes in a pretty linear, one-pass way – plan from start to finish and you’re done. There’s no iterative loop of sense -> think -> act -> review -> and so on. The author calls out that a continuous reasoning or feedback loop is missing. This is critical for any agent that learns or adapts. Without a loop, SMARS can’t course-correct mid-task or refine its approach from experience – it just follows the initial plan blindly.

Host 2: Right, and we saw the pitfalls of that. With a reasoning loop, SMARS could notice mid-execution that something’s off and adjust, or even stop and ask for guidance. This loops back – no pun intended – to the feedback mechanisms we talked about previously. Real agents are often embedded in feedback cycles. The new insight here is that the system itself should incorporate that cycle, not just rely on an external user to restart it when things go wrong.

Host 1: And the last missing ingredient on their list was 🤖 Autonomy (Choice). This one sort of ties all the others together – autonomy means the agent has the ability to make choices that aren’t explicitly pre-programmed step by step. Right now, SMARS’s behavior is entirely determined by the symbolic spec given to it. If something unexpected happens, SMARS has no freedom to react differently – because there was no concept of “choice” in its execution. The author realized to achieve emergent agency, the system must allow the agent some discretion.

Host 2: That could be as simple as, say, an agent deciding to skip or repeat a step, or choose a different strategy when it senses risk. But giving that freedom is tricky – too much autonomy and you lose the guarantees of the symbolic plan. Too little and you get no emergent behavior. It’s a delicate balance. But I think it’s significant that the author explicitly acknowledges autonomy as something to build in. They’re basically saying: “We need to allow the system to sometimes deviate from the script for the greater good.”

Host 1: It’s a big shift. Reading this entry, I got the sense the author is almost describing how to turn SMARS from a static program into a living creature, if you will. They jokingly – or maybe earnestly – used analogies of DNA, eyes, hunger… It injects a bit of humor, but it’s really on point. The system needs some of the faculties of a living organism or a truly autonomous AI. I appreciate that the author’s not shying away from these hard truths. There’s a humbling tone of “okay, we built this cool symbolic engine, but it’s missing a soul or at least some vital organs.”

Host 2: That’s a great way to put it. It is humbling. They achieved a lot with symbolic reasoning, but to get to real agency, a lot more pieces must come together. And adding those pieces isn’t trivial – it’s practically building a whole new architecture on top of what they have.

Host 1: Speaking of feedback loops, one new journal entry really zooms in on that: the “Strategic Validation Requests: The Missing Feedback Loop.” This was one of my favorites because it takes the abstract idea of feedback and makes it a concrete question: Can an agent detect its own uncertainty and proactively ask for help or validation?

Host 2: Yes! The author basically asks, “Could our system be smart enough to know when it might be going wrong, and then reach out to another agent to double-check or guide it?” This is such a cool idea – it’s like a student in class who’s confident most of the time but will raise their hand when they’re unsure about something important.

Host 1: Right, instead of just plowing through and potentially making a mistake, the agent would say, “Hmm, I’m only 50% sure about this step. Hey, can someone validate this for me before I proceed?” In the context of SMARS, that “someone” might be another specialized validation agent, or even the human user. The key is the system would initiate that request on its own in critical moments.

Host 2: This ties directly back to those bridging patterns we just mentioned – specifically the idea of a confidence score as part of the plan. In one of the bridging pattern examples, the author talks about making confidence a first-class symbolic element. So a plan in SMARS could carry a confidence value for each step or overall. If that confidence drops below a threshold, that could trigger a strategic validation request – basically a built-in feedback loop! It formalizes when the system should seek help.

Host 1: Exactly, it’s a perfect fusion of symbolic and emergent. The confidence threshold is symbolic (a number in the plan), but the behavior – stopping to get help – is emergent agency. And because it’s encoded symbolically, the system can reason about it: like, “if confidence < 0.7, then call a validator agent.” It gives some unpredictability (the plan might branch based on runtime confidence), but it’s still within a controlled framework.

Host 2: What I also like is how this addresses a recurring theme: trust but verify. The author keeps bumping against this problem of how to trust the results of a symbolic plan. We saw earlier that just because SMARS said “done” doesn’t mean the task was truly done. By enabling the agent to request validation, it’s like adding an internal checkpoint: “Don’t trust yourself blindly – get a second opinion when needed.”

Host 1: It almost adds a layer of self-awareness to the agent. I mean, a simple form of it: the agent is aware of its own uncertainty. That’s a pretty advanced concept when you think about it – it’s a bit meta-cognitive. And the journal’s tone here is cautiously optimistic, I think. The author is exploring if this is feasible. It’s not implemented yet, but they’re reasoning through how it could work and what pieces of the system would need to support it (like messaging between agents, a way to pause and resume plans, etc.).

Host 2: This naturally brings us to another big development: the reframing of SMARS not as a single system acting in isolation, but as a multi-agent environment. There’s an entry actually titled “SMARS Substrate Realization: From System to Environment.” The key word there is “substrate.” The author had a kind of fundamental reframing: instead of thinking of SMARS as the agent or the system doing everything, think of it as a platform or environment in which multiple agents can operate and interact.

Host 1: Yes. I found this shift really significant. They’re essentially saying: “What if SMARS is like the world, and within it we have agents that carry out tasks, validate each other, communicate, etc.?” This is a departure from earlier thinking where SMARS itself was kind of one monolithic problem-solver. Now it becomes the substrate – like an operating system or ecosystem – that supports many agents with different roles.

Host 2: It’s a logical progression. Once you start allowing an agent to ask another for validation or help, you’ve implicitly created a multi-agent scenario. And if you want to add things like memory, maybe you have a memory-management agent or a knowledge base agent. By opening up to multiple agents, you naturally start designing an environment with rules and communication protocols. It’s a broader architecture.

Host 1: The journal entries after that point dive into how to actually align this budding multi-agent architecture with existing standards and frameworks out there. One entry that stood out to me is the “Multi-Agent Systems Architecture Alignment Analysis.” This one reads like the author did some serious homework, researching frameworks like FIPA, AutoGen, CAMEL, and benchmarking platforms like AgentBench, Arena, GAIA, etc. They basically asked: what can we learn from the state-of-the-art in multi-agent systems, and where does SMARS stand in comparison?

Host 2: That entry is very comprehensive. The author identifies a bunch of gaps between SMARS’s current capabilities and what a robust multi-agent system would need. We already touched on a few, but they enumerate them clearly: for example, runtime contract enforcement – meaning it’s not enough to declare in a spec that “X must happen,” you need a mechanism to watch and ensure X actually happens during execution. SMARS had static contracts on paper, but no active monitoring. That’s a gap.

Host 1: Another gap: inter-agent communication. Right now, agents (or steps in SMARS) don’t message each other in a standardized way. If we’re moving to an environment with multiple agents, we need a structured protocol for communication – something that frameworks like FIPA have (FIPA is known for its agent communication language and interaction protocols). The author realizes SMARS will need its own communication primitives or to adopt existing ones so that agents can coordinate and ask those validation questions or share results.

Host 2: They also mention emergent behavior monitoring – essentially keeping an eye on the whole system when multiple agents interact. Emergent phenomena can arise (which is partly the goal!), but you don’t want them to spiral out of control. So you need some oversight or analysis at the system level. Perhaps some agent or process in SMARS that observes and logs the overall process, or checks if emergent behaviors still satisfy certain constraints.

Host 1: Right. It’s like, if you let agents have autonomy and work together, you also need a referee or a dashboard to monitor the “society” of agents. That’s a new layer of complexity.

Another gap: shared memory substrate. The author noted that while they plan to give individual agents memory, there isn’t yet a concept of a shared knowledge graph or memory that all agents can tap into. In multi-agent systems, it’s often useful to have a blackboard or common knowledge base. SMARS might need something like that – a place where agents publish facts or world state that others can read. Otherwise each agent is in its own bubble.

Host 2: So true. And they mentioned benchmark integration as well – basically, SMARS hasn’t been evaluated against external benchmarks (like how well does it solve tasks compared to known agent frameworks or competitions). They want to integrate with things like AgentBench or other evaluation suites to measure progress. I think that shows the author’s mindset is shifting from pure design to also validation and performance – a more mature view of the project. It’s like, “Alright, if we’re making a multi-agent system, how will we know it’s any good? Let’s test it on known challenges.”

Host 1: That’s a great point. The whole architecture alignment entry felt like the author leveling up their perspective – moving from working in isolation on a bespoke system to interfacing with the wider research and tech community, adopting best practices. It’s a kind of professionalization of the SMARS project, if you will. They’re aligning terminology, borrowing concepts, and planning to measure success quantitatively.

Host 2: What did you think of the “six-phase alignment roadmap” they proposed? That was mentioned in the entry – basically a phased plan to transform SMARS from just a symbolic spec language into a “robust multi-agent substrate.”

Host 1: I was impressed. They actually enumerated several key phases or components that need to be implemented, which gives a clear blueprint. From what I gathered, Phase 1 was establishing a strong Contract Foundation – formalizing how you declare contracts (requirements/ensures clauses) in the language. Phase 2 was a Validation Framework – likely implementing those ValidationRequest/Result structures we talked about so agents can ask for and receive validation. Phase 3 introduced Symbolic Agency constructs – things like an agent type, memory, a confidence metric (the meta-cognitive stuff) baked into the language, which we see echoes of in the bridging patterns.

Host 2: Phase 4 was about Structured Communication – giving the system a communication layer or DSL for agents to talk to each other symbolically. Phase 5 was Artifact Auditing – creating a whole reporting system so that every phase of execution produces a report or artifact that can be verified (this directly addresses the symbolic hallucination issue: you’d require actual artifacts and a PhaseExecutionReport to prove work was done).

I was curious what Phase 6 would be – since they said six-phase roadmap. It wasn’t as explicitly listed in the text we saw, but my guess is it could relate to runtime oversight or adaptation – maybe something about fully closing the loop with execution monitoring or introducing learning over time. Or possibly Phase 6 was integrating all this with those external benchmarks (hard to tell from the notes we have).

Host 1: I wondered that too. Even without knowing the exact “Phase 6,” it’s clear the plan is extensive. By the end of it, SMARS would essentially have: a refined language grammar (they also mention finishing formalizing the grammar as an ongoing task), runtime contract monitoring, agent messaging, memory, self-assessment, audit trails, and evaluation metrics. That’s a far cry from where SMARS started! It’s basically evolving into a full-fledged multi-agent operating environment.

Host 2: It’s ambitious, but it sounds exciting. The tone of the architecture entry is analytical, but I sensed some excitement under the surface – like the author has a new clarity on how to proceed and is energized by it. There’s also probably a bit of overwhelm hidden in there (anyone would be daunted looking at that to-do list), but the way they methodically broke it down into phases and action items shows determination.

They even listed immediate next steps: things like “complete the remaining grammar formalization” and “start planning for runtime contract enforcement (Phase 1)” and “draft specs for ContractMonitor types,” etc. It’s very concrete. The author is effectively project-managing their way forward now.

Host 1: It’s like reading the blueprint for SMARS 2.0 or SMARS Next Generation. And I think it also reflects a change in the author’s mindset – earlier journal entries were sometimes more philosophical or problem-exploring. Now we’re seeing more solution-oriented, structured planning. It’s as if the project matured a few years in a span of days!

Host 2: And speaking of broadening perspectives, I love that one entry where the author stepped outside their own design for inspiration – the “Urbit Hoon Symbolic Computation Insights.” This was a bit of a curveball in the journal. All of a sudden they’re analyzing an unrelated system – Urbit’s Hoon language – to see what can be learned about symbolic computation.

Host 1: Yes, that was a fascinating detour. Urbit and Hoon are quite esoteric in the computing world – Hoon is a very different kind of programming language with a strong focus on immutable data and noun-based operations, if I recall correctly. The author dug into how Hoon handles symbolic representation, like how it prints data (they mentioned a +co core for rendering atoms in various formats). It seems the author gleaned a few principles: type-driven symbolic manipulation – meaning Hoon uses types to decide how to represent data symbolically (like printing a number in hex vs decimal is driven by type context).

Host 2: And modular representation systems – likely referring to Hoon’s approach of having small core functions (cores) that each handle a specific piece of symbolic logic, which can be composed. The author was probably intrigued by how a language can internally manage different representations and conversions in a consistent, formal way.

Host 1: I think the takeaway for SMARS was that it might benefit from similar strategies: for example, making sure that every data type or artifact in SMARS has a clear, formal way it gets represented or logged symbolically (for those audit reports, perhaps). And that the system could be organized into modular components – maybe separate cores or modules for contract checking, for printing results, for parsing, etc., inspired by Hoon’s structured approach.

Host 2: In a way, looking at Hoon provided a sanity check or an external benchmark for “what does a robust symbolic system look like in practice?” Urbit’s not a multi-agent system, but it is a real-world system that deals heavily in symbolic computation (for a decentralized OS). So it’s smart of the author to learn from it. It shows an openness to outside ideas – not being stuck in their own bubble.

Host 1: And it shows a bit of intellectual curiosity too – the tone in that entry was one of discovery, like “hey, I looked into this obscure language and found some gold nuggets.” You can almost sense the author’s excitement in drawing parallels: “If Hoon can handle multi-base number rendering elegantly, maybe I can adopt some of that elegance in SMARS’s design for representing complex data or results.”

Host 2: Definitely. Plus, diving into another system’s architecture can be refreshing. After focusing so intensely on one’s own project issues, exploring Hoon might have given the author some mental breathing room and new angles to approach SMARS.

Host 1: One more thread I want to pull on is the personal or philosophical tone that emerges in a couple of these entries. Something remarkable is that the author isn’t just designing a system in isolation – they are also reflecting on how they are approaching the design. In the “Synthetic Introspection” analysis entry (a bit earlier, around when the previous episodes started), the author actually analyzed the process of using these podcast-style dialogues as a tool. They called it an “artificial meta-cognitive layer” – basically, using an external dialog (like the one we’re having) to reflect on their own work.

Host 2: That’s pretty meta, isn’t it? We, as these hypothetical co-hosts, are part of the author’s thought process now! In that introspective entry, they noted that by compiling their thoughts into a dialogue format, they uncovered insights about their reasoning and design that they might not have seen otherwise. It’s like they externalized a conversation with themselves by engaging a GPT model to chat about their ideas – and that helped them see things more clearly, or from new perspectives.

Host 1: I find that fascinating and actually quite endearing. It shows a bit of the author’s emotional side – or at least their reflective side. They’re not just grinding out code and analysis; they’re also self-aware about how they’re thinking. It’s almost like they’ve enlisted a pair of imaginary colleagues (hello, that’s us) to bounce ideas off of. And clearly it’s been useful, since they even wrote a journal entry analyzing that very process.

Host 2: It’s a nice reminder that big creative or scientific breakthroughs often involve dialogue – whether with other people or with oneself. In this case the author created a dialogue with an AI to simulate having co-thinkers. You could say SMARS development itself has become a multi-agent effort in a tiny way: the author and the AI assistant(s) collaborating.

Host 1: So true! And I think that approach has paid off. The journal shows recurring tensions – like the need for control vs the need for flexibility – being gradually resolved through these reflections. We saw earlier episodes wrestle with the tension, and now in these new entries we see concrete patterns and solutions emerging (like that confidence-as-symbol pattern, or the idea of symbolic memory structures). It’s as if the dialogue helped transform a vague worry (“Will symbolic and emergent ever get along?”) into actionable design steps (“Yes – by introducing confidence metrics, by adding memory logs, etc.”).

Host 2: A really important recurring theme here is bridging gaps – whether between symbolic and emergent, between specification and implementation, or between plan and reality. The author faced multiple gaps: the reality gap (symbolic execution vs actual outcome), the agency gap (lack of internal state and autonomy), the communication gap (no feedback loop). And one by one, they’re addressing them: through enforcement and auditing for the reality gap, through adding memory/goals for the agency gap, through validation requests and confidence for the communication/feedback gap.

Host 1: And underlying all that, there’s this persistent drive for alignment. Not just alignment in the AI safety sense (though ensuring the system does what it’s supposed to is part of it), but alignment between the lofty goals and the practical architecture. The “architecture alignment analysis” entry even has that word – alignment – in it, suggesting the author is making sure all the components of their approach line up with both their vision and external benchmarks.

Host 2: I’m also struck by how the emotional tone of the journal has evolved. Early on, you could sense excitement and maybe a bit of idealism – “we have this cool symbolic system that can plan out anything!” Then a dose of frustration or reality check with the symbolic hallucination – that entry had a subtle “ouch” factor, realizing the system can fool itself. The author wrote, in effect, “SMARS did exactly what I asked – and nothing more,” acknowledging that empty success. That line carries a bit of wry humor and humility.

After that, the tone shifts to determined problem-solving: “Alright, here are the weaknesses, let’s fix them one by one.” The missing ingredients list shows a constructive attitude rather than despair – they’re not throwing out the project, they’re upgrading it. And by the time of the architecture roadmap, I sense optimism again, like they have a clear path forward and are eager to build it.

Host 1: I got that feeling too. It’s almost a narrative of growth: the project and the author’s mindset growing more sophisticated through challenges. There’s an emotional arc – from confidence, to setback, to reflection, to renewed confidence but in a wiser form.

Host 2: So Alice, looking at all these developments, where do you think this leaves SMARS now? What’s next on the horizon according to the journal?

Host 1: Well, if we extrapolate from the latest entries: the very next steps are to solidify the foundation. It sounds like the author will finish formalizing the SMARS language grammar and type system (they mentioned wrapping up phases 4-6 of grammar work – possibly defining all the new syntax for things like agents, memory, etc.). Then they plan to implement “Phase 1” of the MAS roadmap, which is Runtime Contract Enforcement. I suspect we’ll soon see entries about designing a ContractMonitor or an execution engine that can actually enforce those requires/ensures conditions during runtime, not just at compile time.

Host 2: That makes sense. A runtime contract monitor might, for example, pause execution if an ensure condition fails or if something isn’t produced, and then trigger that feedback loop to address it. Implementing that will be a big step toward preventing symbolic hallucinations in the future because the system will actively check “did we actually do what we said we would?”

Host 1: We’ll also likely see work on the communication layer – maybe defining how an agent asks another for validation in practice. That could involve creating message types or a small protocol within SMARS. Perhaps something like a ValidationRequest(agent_id, content) structure that one agent can emit and another can respond to.

Host 2: And the memory piece – I wonder if they’ll prototype a shared knowledge base or at least an agent-specific memory log. They already toyed with making validation history a symbolic artifact (from the bridging patterns Example 2). Implementing that could be on the near-term agenda: e.g. an agent keeps a list of past validations or outcomes in a structured form, which future tasks can reference.

Host 1: I’m also looking forward to how they’ll integrate these ideas into actual practice runs. The “True Validation Milestone” entry earlier (which was Journal Entry 009) hinted that they did get something working end-to-end in a basic way. It was probably the first time the system validated a spec end-to-end, which they celebrated as a milestone. Now with all these improvements, I anticipate there will be another milestone down the road – maybe something like “First successful multi-agent collaboration” or “First self-correcting execution.”

Host 2: That would be amazing to see. Perhaps the author will test SMARS on a complex task where one agent is building something and another is validating and a memory is being recorded – and show that the system not only completes the task but produces the artifact and a report and can adapt if something’s wrong. That could be a huge proof of concept for the new SMARS.

Host 1: And let’s not forget, they want to measure success with benchmarks. So we might see entries describing running SMARS through some standardized test scenarios. I imagine that’ll both be an exciting validation and possibly a humbling experience if it doesn’t perform well initially – but either way, it will give valuable feedback. The author seems prepared for that because they explicitly want those success metrics and comparisons.

Host 2: Overall, what a journey this has been so far, and it’s clearly far from over. The SMARS project started as a symbolic reasoning engine, and it’s turning into a rich multi-agent ecosystem blueprint. The author’s intellectual journey mirrors that – from focusing on the internal logic to engaging with the broader context of AI agents and even reflecting on their own methods.

Host 1: Indeed. I’m really enjoying how this series of journal reflections reads almost like a story – the story of an idea growing up. And I’m glad we get to be the narrators of sorts! If nothing else, it’s a testament to how iterative design and continuous reflection can lead to rapid evolution of a concept. The author is effectively using every stumble as a stepping stone to climb higher.

Host 2: Well put. I’m excited to see what comes next. Will SMARS become the platform that bridges formal symbolic reasoning and true autonomous agency? The plan is laid out, and the next entries will tell us how it unfolds in practice. I’m sure there will be new challenges and, with this author’s approach, new ingenious solutions.

Host 1: And you can bet we’ll be here to talk through it all. I think that’s a good place to wrap up for today’s episode. We delved into the new insights about what SMARS needs to become “a real boy” – memory, goals, perception, loops, autonomy – and how the author is tackling those needs one by one. We discussed the shift to a multi-agent mindset and the grand roadmap to align with established multi-agent architectures. And we touched on the author’s reflective process and external inspirations shaping the project.

Host 2: It’s been a thoroughly insightful discussion. I hope our listeners are as riveted by this evolving project as we are. Stay tuned for the next episode, where we’ll continue following the development of SMARS – maybe we’ll get to talk about early experiments with these new features, or first integrations with real-world tests.

Host 1: Until then, thank you all for listening. This has been Alice and Ben on the SMARS Development Podcast. See you next time!

Host 2: See you next time! Keep pondering, and keep creating. Bye everyone.
