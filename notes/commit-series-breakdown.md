## Commit Execution Strategy

### Preparation Steps
1. **Review each commit scope** - Ensure logical grouping
2. **Check file dependencies** - Verify no cross-commit dependencies
3. **Validate commit messages** - Follow established conventions
4. **Test after each commit** - Ensure system remains functional

### Execution Order
Execute commits in numerical order (1-9) to maintain logical progression:
1. **Foundation**: Journal entries documenting the journey
2. **Validation**: Plan validation framework
3. **Agency Core**: Symbolic agency constructs
4. **Implementation**: Agency implementation guide
5. **Collaboration**: Multi-agent protocols
6. **Integration**: Foundation model mapping
7. **Grammar**: Language enhancements
8. **Advanced**: Latent reasoning exploration
9. **Assessment**: System evaluation

### Benefits of This Structure
- **Logical Progression**: Each commit builds on previous work
- **Focused Changes**: Each commit addresses specific capability
- **Reviewable**: Clear scope and purpose for each commit
- **Traceable**: Development journey is well-documented
- **Modular**: Individual commits can be reviewed independently

## Alternative Grouping Options

### Option A: Feature-Based (Current Recommendation)
- Groups by major capability (validation, agency, collaboration, etc.)
- Clear functional boundaries
- Easy to understand impact of each commit

### Option B: Chronological
- Groups by development timeline
- Shows natural progression
- May mix different types of changes

### Option C: Type-Based
- Groups by artifact type (specs, implementations, journals, etc.)
- Consistent change types per commit
- May break logical feature boundaries

## Recommendation

**Use Feature-Based Grouping (Option A)** as outlined above because:
- Each commit represents a complete capability
- Logical progression from foundation to advanced features
- Clear functional boundaries for review
- Maintains traceability of development journey
- Enables selective integration of capabilities

This structure provides a clean, logical commit history that tells the story of symbolic agency development while maintaining practical review and integration capabilities.
