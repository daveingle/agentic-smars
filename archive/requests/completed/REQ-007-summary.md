**Workflow Validation**:
- Confirmed consistent application of SMARS workflow
- Identified "Simon says" pattern as training mechanism for workflow adherence

## Generated Artifacts

- Cue standardization insights
- Format consistency recommendations
- Workflow compliance validation patterns

## Outcomes

1. **Format Standardization Need**: Identified requirement for consistent cue file structure
2. **Traceability Enhancement**: All cues should reference generation context
3. **Quality Assurance**: Cue review integrated into workflow
4. **Training Pattern**: "Simon says" approach ensures workflow consistency

**Result**: Established foundation for cue standardization and quality assurance processes.
