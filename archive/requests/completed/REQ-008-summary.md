# REQ-008: System Evaluation Setup

**Request Description**: "setup the plan to evaluate system behaviour given sample requests"  
**Requester Role**: user  
**Status**: completed  

## Summary

Established systematic approach for evaluating SMARS system behavior across different request types. Created framework to test workflow compliance, artifact generation quality, and symbolic consistency.

## Key Outcomes

1. **Evaluation Framework Design**: Formal SMARS specification for system behavior evaluation
2. **Request Categorization**: Identified categories (informational, file_operations, system_modification, meta_requests, complex_multi_step)
3. **Performance Metrics**: Success criteria for workflow compliance, artifact quality, traceability
4. **Systematic Testing**: Plan for evaluating system across different request scenarios

## Generated Artifacts

- System evaluation SMARS specification with types:
  - `RequestSample`, `EvaluationMetric`, `SystemBehaviorResult`
  - `evaluateSystemBehavior` plan with formal contracts
  - Request category definitions
- Evaluation methodology for measuring system performance

## Specification Created

```smars
@role(architect)

(kind RequestSample ∷ { id: STRING, description: STRING, category: STRING, expected_artifacts: [STRING] })
(kind EvaluationMetric ∷ { name: STRING, measurement_method: STRING, success_threshold: FLOAT })
(kind SystemBehaviorResult ∷ { request_id: STRING, workflow_compliance: BOOL, artifact_quality: FLOAT, traceability_complete: BOOL, symbolic_consistency: BOOL })

(plan evaluateSystemBehavior § steps: prepareSampleRequests - executeRequestSamples - measurePerformanceMetrics - analyzeWorkflowCompliance - generateEvaluationReport - identifyImprovementOpportunities)

(contract evaluateSystemBehavior ⊨ requires: sample_requests_defined ⊨ ensures: system_performance_measured ∧ improvement_opportunities_identified)
```

**Result**: Formal system evaluation capability established with symbolic specification.
