# SMARS Workflow

This document defines the structure and symbolic flow for **agentic reasoning systems** that implement, extend, or collaborate using the SMARS language.

It is not tied to a single project, product, or codebase.  
It serves as a reusable scaffold for software agents that reason and act over symbolic representations of behavior, plans, and responsibilities.

---

## Purpose

This repository consolidates a symbolic operating framework based on SMARS — the Symbolic Multi-Agent Reasoning System.

It is a formal, deterministic coordination language designed to:

- Describe and audit plans, contracts, and flow logic
- Support AI planning, interpretation, and debugging
- Serve as the foundation for agent-to-agent or human-agent collaboration

## Design Philosophy

- **Symbolic clarity** over narrative complexity
- **Plans first**, not tasks
- **Testable behavior** embedded in the plan
- **LLM-native** interface without prompt engineering
- **Human-readable**, **agent-auditable**

This system is not a substitute for programming — it is a structure **around programming**.

---

## What This Repo Is

- A working symbolic protocol for agentic development
- A reusable reference for AI/human alignment in software planning
- A staging ground for SMARS-based systems or tooling

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- A backlog for active development
- A framework for a specific app or domain
- A place to file issues about bugs or features

## Feedback

If you’re exploring symbolic systems or agent coordination, I’d be happy to hear your thoughts.

Feel free to open an issue or propose a refinement to this structure.
