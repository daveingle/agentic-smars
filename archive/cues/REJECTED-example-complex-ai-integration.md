# REJECTED Cue: Complex AI Integration

**Original Generation**: Hypothetical example for demonstration
**Rejection Date**: 2025-07-17
**Evaluator**: Claude

## Original Cue

(cue integrate_complex_ai_models ⊨ suggests: integrate multiple large language models with complex orchestration for enhanced reasoning capabilities)

## Evaluation Results

(datum ⟦cue_evaluated⟧ ∷ CueEvaluation = {
  cue_id: "integrate_complex_ai_models",
  technical_feasibility: 0.3,
  system_alignment: 0.5,
  implementation_complexity: 0.2,
  value_proposition: 0.6,
  combined_score: 0.4,
  promotion_recommended: false,
  rejection_reason: "Technical feasibility too low (0.3 < 0.4), implementation complexity too high (0.2 < 0.4)",
  evaluator: "Claude",
  evaluation_date: "2025-07-17"
})

## Rejection Rationale

**Technical Feasibility (0.3)**: Requires significant infrastructure changes and complex model orchestration beyond current system capabilities.

**Implementation Complexity (0.2)**: Extremely high complexity requiring major architectural changes, resource management, and coordination systems.

**Rejection Criteria Met**: 
- Technical feasibility < 0.4 (automatic rejection)
- Implementation complexity < 0.4 (automatic rejection)
- Combined score < 0.5 (insufficient overall value)

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Simplify Integration**: Focus on single model integration first
2. **Incremental Approach**: Build foundational capabilities before complex orchestration
3. **Resource Planning**: Develop infrastructure requirements analysis
4. **Proof of Concept**: Create small-scale demonstration before full implementation

## Future Reconsideration

This cue may be reconsidered when:
- System infrastructure capabilities are enhanced
- Simpler AI integrations are successfully implemented
- Resource constraints are reduced
- Technical feasibility improves through system evolution

**Status**: REJECTED - Archive maintained for future reference
